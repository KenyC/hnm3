## Practical information for presenters

**Information for in-person presenters**: Since this will be a **hybrid
event** with several presenters joining us online from outside Europe,
we will use a single computer for all in-person presenters to make sure
that the Zoom/audio set-up works. We therefore ask everyone who is
presenting **in person** to **email us their slides** at
*gapsandimprecision \[at\] gmail.com* until the day before their talk.

Similarly, if you are presenting in person and using a handout, please
**send us your handout via email** in advance.

**Full talk** presenters have a **40-minute** slot (this includes both
presentation and discussion time). It is up to you how exactly to divide
the slot, but ideally try to aim for 10 minutes or more of discussion
time.

**Short talk** presenters have a **20-minute** slot (this includes both
presentation and discussion time). It is up to you how exactly to divide
the slot, but ideally try to aim for 5 minutes or more of discussion
time.



## How to get to the venue

The best way to get around Berlin is by metro (U-Bahn) and local train
(S-Bahn).

-   The venue (**Pariser Straße 1**) is near the metro
    station**Spichernstraße**, which is served by the **U3** and **U9**
    lines.
-   The metro station is a bit labyrinthic. Try to follow the signs for
    **exit D**, which is right next to the venue.

**How to get there from the main train station (Berlin Hbf):** Take the
S-Bahn to **Zoologischer Garten**(3 stops in the western direction),
and change to the metro line **U9** there (you have to leave the station
building to get to the metro entrance). From there, it\'s only two stops
to Spichernstraße.

**How to get there from the airport:** Take a regional train to the main
train station (**Berlin Hbf**). Most of these trains are
labeled **FEX**, but some of them might have other labels. From there,
take a train go to **Zoologischer Garten** station (it is worth checking
whether your train from the airport stops there after Berlin Hbf). At
Zoologischer Garten, change to the metro line **U9** (you have to leave
the station building to get to the metro entrance) and go
to Spichernstraße (2 stops).

**Note:** Berlin-Brandenburg airport is quite far away from the city
center, so it might well take you a bit more than an hour to get to the
venue. 

The workshop will take place in **Ilse-Zimmermann-Saal**, which is to
the left of the main entrance of the building at Pariser Straße 1.
Please note the following complications:

-   The building is shared with several other institutions and private
    companies and usually not open to the public. We will try to keep
    the main entrance open throughout, but in case someone else closes
    it and you can\'t get in, send us a message.
-   There is another seminar room on the other end of the building,
    which has a different address (Meierottostraße 8). If you feel you
    are in the wrong place, try to walk around the building to the other
    room.
